The package explores functional programming (map, reduce, operators, recursion, etc.). Motivating questions include

* Is factoring out looping w/ map truly better than having loops within each function?
* If I come back to the code after 3 months, can I understand it? 
* How hidden are the dependencies? 
* Do higher order functions feel like a purpose built tools or forcing a round peg in a square hole?
* Is there some aspect of R's language definition that prevent functional implementations?

This package implements standard algorithms using a functional programming approach to answer these questions.
